## Based on Coatjava Release 13.4.0


# Release notes

- Moved GEMC api from repo gemc/api 
- PERL API improved in handling of empty strings
- Moved geometry source from repo gemc/detectors/clas12 into dir geometry_source
- GCards updated and made consistent for all detectors. 
- Detectors README updated and made consistent for all detectors
- Main README updated
- Each detector directory now contains gcards loading the detector geometry: 
  1. an ASCII gcard for each available variation
  2. an SQLITE gcard for all run numbers (each corresponding to a variation) 
- General workflow improvements, including coatjava version option in create_geometry script
- New Cad import mechanism
  - gxml files specify only the volumes needed for the simulation (CLAS12 Note 2024-010)
- Various CI improvements and additions
  - Ci includes comparison between TEXT and SQLITE geometry and output
  - Added Ntracks metricks profile action: testing 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 tracks, with configurations.
  - Added valgrind action: artifact creates trace file
  - Actions logs uploads
  - Added Ubuntu built
- Fixed materials for LTCC WC
- BMT minor fixes to address overlaps
- Target code reorganizations: made consistent for all run groups 
- Added RGE, RGM, RGD targets per run numbers
- Various geometry fixes for DDVCS 
- Felix: alert digitization updates
- Alert detectors code moved to top alert dir, and various geometry/digitization fixes
- RICH STL volumes improvements. 
- using CCDB RF offset in RFSETUP
