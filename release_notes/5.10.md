# clas12_tags 5.10

- identical to 5.9 but uses Geant4 10.7.4 instead of 10.6.2
- using c++17 standards to be compatible with hipo 4.1.0

- Eric Fuchey: added documentation for alert geometry, updated alert geometry, gcards, and bank variables
- Whitney Armstrong: alert bank variables changes in source code
- RICH geometry update (Connor Pecar)
- Added README.md templates and uRwell gcard
- Moved downstream shield volumes from beamline to torus where the apex is implemented (Raffaella).
- Added beamline fton ftoff gcards, fixed ftoff vacuum entrance and airpipe length
- resolved an overlap between target and scattering chamber, created regular polycone to replace incomplete CAD beamline shield, updated gcard (Raffaella).
- fixed raster options for LUND format
- added new transverse solenoid map option: Full_transsolenoid_x321_y161_z321_April2024
- added fton ftoff gcard, fixed ftoff vacuum entrance and airpipe length
- moved DSS (downstream shield) volumes from beamline to torus where the apex is implemented (Raffella)

## Release note for deprecated  clas12_tags 5.7

- added SQLITE support for geometry and materials
- fixed vertex units for the smearing options (not really, 5.9 has the complete fix)

## Release note for deprecated clas12_tags 5.5

- added uRwell geometry and digitization 
- FADC time is double not int. Precision is 62.5ps
- target and beamline vacuum windows now native geant4 volumes
- fixed width of scattering chamber vacuum window and added beamline vacuum window
- added instrospection: -v, --v, -version, --version will show the version of gemc and the following:
- field persistence for 2 and 3d maps is float instead of double
- updated RICH hitprocess
- updated interface to FrequencySyncSignal to pass one of engine status longs as seed, to guarantee reproducibility of RFs
- added support for Full_transsolenoid_x161_y161_z321_March2021 binary map.
