- use JLAB_VERSION 2.1, with new mlibrary
- Micromegas: updated  geometry and digitization
- DC: realistic time to distance function, reading constants from CCDB
- DC: ministagger for DC region 3: "even closer" layers 1,3,5: +300um, SL 2,4,6: -300um
- LTCC: Reading CCDB SPE calibration constants
- LTCC: Smearing ADC based on calibration constants
- CTOF javacad instead of cad (should be indentical)
- Fixed smeared infor in generated summary for FASTMC mode
- improved/fixed CND digitization routine
- updated RF timing (mlibrary)
- BST+MM: using 3+3 configurations (no FMT)
