- ctof, ftof banks: 1 ADC output / pmt instead of ADCL/ADCR for a single paddle)
- CTOF, FTOF Paddle to PMT digitization for FADC
- background merging algorithm framework
- background merging algorithm implementation in digitization: DC, BST and MM.
- Correct field geant4-caching
- Solenoid integration method: G4ClassicalRK4 to fix some geant4 navigation issues in the field. Slower but more reliable (should have less crashes)
- SYNRAD option to activate synchrotone radiation in vacuum (SYNRAD=1) or any material (SYNRAD=2)
- dc gas material changed to 90% Ar, 10% G4_CARBON_DIOXIDE.
- RF shift from target center: added option RFSTART: Radio-frequency time model. Available values are:
  - "eventVertex, 0, 0, 0" (default): the RF time is the event start time + the light time-distance of the first particle from the point (0,0,0)
  - "eventTime".....................: the RF time is identical to the event start time
