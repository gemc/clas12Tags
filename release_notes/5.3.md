# clas12_tags 5.3 compatible with COATJAVA 6.5.6.1 and above.

- removed the switch_antialiasing OpenGL function to make it compatible with apple arm chips.
- the binary field entry is now a string containing, in order, the solenoid and torus field maps filenames, separated
by a colon. For example: 
  - `Symm_solenoid_r601_phi1_z1201_13June2018:Full_torus_r251_phi181_z251_25Jan2021`
  - `Symm_solenoid_r601_phi1_z1201_13June2018:Symm_torus_r2501_phi16_z251_24Apr2018`

  The first one of these two examples is the one used in reconstruction, which is now also used in gemc. 
  The second one is the one used in the past in gemc, and equivalent to the ASCII maps.  

- from Raffaella: added option of choosing the beam particle time independently of the LUMI time window, 
  random population of beam bunches with lumi options
- last-a-foam geometry update for EC
