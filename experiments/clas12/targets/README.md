# Experiments:


## RGF: Sept 22 2022

Author: Yu-Chun Hung

Experiment Description: Measure the structure function F2 of the neutron by 
tagging the spectator proton in the RTPC detector. Deuterium, hydrogen, and helium gas are used at 5.6 atm pressure.

### Variations: bonusD2, bounsH2, bonusHe

### Files used: 

### How to use it in the gcard
1. Set up the target with bonusD2 variations:
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/target" factory="TEXT" variation="bonusD2"/>
2. Shift the target position by 30 mm
<detector name="target">    <position x="0*cm"  y="0*cm"  z="-3.00*cm"  />  </detector>


## RGM: Sept 20 2022

Author: Justin Estee

Experiment Description: Short Range Correlations & Electrons for Neutrinos experiment 


### Variations: 
Liquid Targets (Standard 5cm liquid cell)
lH2 - liquid Hydrogen
lD2 - liquid Deuterium
lHe - liquid Helium

Solid Targets
RGM_2_C - single foil carbon target in beamline
RGM_2_Sn - single foil tin target in beamline

RGM_8_C_L - 4-foil carbon target in beamline. Large carbon target option.
RGM_8_Sn_L - 4-foil tin target in beamline. Large tin target option.

RGM_8_C_S - 4-foil carbon target in beamline. Small carbon target option.
RGM_8_Sn_S - 4-foil tin target in beamline. Small tin target option.

RGM_Ca - Calcium target cell

Scattering chamber variations
cad - standard scattering chamber and liquid cell target wall entrance and exit material
cadrgm - standard scattering chamber without liquid cell wall and upstream window, only downstream window and pipe included (use with solid targets)
### Files used


### How to use it in the gcard
Liquid Targets
Use "cad" variation with all liquid targets
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/cad/"   factory="CAD"/>
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/target" factory="TEXT" variation="lD2"/>

Solid Targets
Use "cadrgm" variation with all solid targets
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/cadrgm/"   factory="CAD"/>
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/target" factory="TEXT" variation="RGM_2_C"/>

## RG-D: May 17th, 2024

Author: Lamiaa El Fassi

Experiment Description: Color Transparency & nTMDs

### Variations: 
1. Liquid Targets (Standard 5cm liquid cell):
lD2 - liquid Deuterium

2. Solid Targets:
lD2CxC - Empty lD2 cell + two 12C foils in the beamline
lD2CuSn - Empty lD2 cell + 63Cu and 120Sn in series in the beamline

### How to use it in the gcard
1. For lD2 variations:
Set it up as in "clas12_lD2-RGD.gcard", and
shift the target upstream by 50 mm, see  "clas12_lD2-RGD.gcard".
2. Solid Targets:
Set it up for lD2CxC/lD2CuSn variation as in "clas12_12C-RGD.gcard/clas12_120Sn-RGD.gcard or clas12_63Cu-RGD.gcard", and 
shift the whole target assembly upstream by 150 mm to get the two solid foils @ -7.5 cm and -2.5 cm, as the entrance and exit windows for the lD2 case; see the mentioned three solid-foil gcards.
<detector name="target">    <position x="0.0*cm"  y="0.0*cm"  z="-15.0*cm"  />  </detector>

## RG-E: Sep 23th, 2024

Author: Antonio Radic

Experiment Description: Double target to study hadronization process. Liquid deuterium target and solid nuclear target exposed to the electron beam at the same time.
Solid targets inlcude Carbon, Aluminum, Copper, Tin, and Lead.

### Variations: 
1. Liquid Target (2cm liquid cell):
2cm-lD2 - liquid Deuterium
2cm-lD2-empty - empty liquid Deuterium cell

2. Solid Target:
For solid selection, modify CAD subdirectory:
C - Band positioned with C foil in front of the beam
Al - Band positioned with Al foil in front of the beam
Cu - Band positioned with Cu foil in front of the beam
Sn - Band positioned with Sn foil in front of the beam
Pb - Band positioned with Pb foil in front of the beam
Empty - Band positioned with empty hole in front of the beam

### How to use it in the gcard
1. Choose LD2 variation:
Set it up in "clas12-RGE.gcard" to choose full or empty deuterium cell"
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/target"         factory="TEXT" variation="2cm-lD2"/>

2. Choose Solid Target:
Change solid target in "clas12-RGE.gcard" by choosing a subdirectory that contains CAD models for the requiered solid target configuration:
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/rge-dt/C/"  factory="CAD"/>

### gcard name format:
Format of the included gcards for RGE have the following format:

clas12-RGE_[liquid-target]-[solid-target]-[magnetic-field].gcard

Where [magnetic-field] corresponds to Inbending (In), Outbending (Out), or Zero field (Zero).

### Notes
clas12-RGE_example.gcard is just an example of an RG-E gcard. It could be updated later depending on the GEMC updates and releases. Please verify it before using.
