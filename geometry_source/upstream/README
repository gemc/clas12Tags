CLAS12 UPSTREAM README

--------------------------------------------------

These directories contain the definitions for select 
geomtries upstream of the target.  These geometries include:
- Upstream beampipe
- MVT electronics racks and electronics cards
- CND lightguides
- MVT and SVT support pipes

Note that the SVT cart is defined in detectors/band/geometry.pl

The commands to build the geometry and materials (in the 
respective directories) are:

perl beampipeUpstream.pl config.dat
perl cndUpstream.pl config.dat
perl mvtElectronics.pl config.dat
perl supportsUpstream.pl config.dat

These commands will create the following geometry files that 
should be included in GEMC:

detectors/clas12/upstream/beampipeUpstream/beampipeUpstream__geometry_main.txt
detectors/clas12/upstream/cndUpstream/cndUpstream__geometry_main.txt
detectors/clas12/upstream/mvtElectronics/mvtElectronics__geometry_main.txt
detectors/clas12/upstream/supportsUpstream/supportsUpstream__geometry_main.txt
